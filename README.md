# VR Analytics
I worked as a research assistant at [Professor Gorlatova's I^3T Lab](https://maria.gorlatova.com/facilities-and-resources/) on a VR simulation research project. 
The research required analyzing user's behaviors when interacting with different simulated AR content.
I created this github project to develop a perhaps more generally applicable workflow of analyzing VR user behavior.
## Project Architecture

Currently, I am developing the analytics part of the project. I plan to generalize the C# code in the HMD that gather data and create a small package later.
## Existing Use Cases
This project was used in a further study based off of this [ISMAR 2022 paper](https://maria.gorlatova.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ISMAR2022aGorlatova_IntegratedDesign.pdf) authored by my mentor [Tim Scargill](https://sites.duke.edu/timscargill/).
In the study, we were interested in how the test subjects are influenced by the simulated environment. 
We measured the test subject's gaze direction, interactions with different objects etc. to quantify the VR environmental impact on the subject.

## Future Use Cases
After adding some feature, this tool could help you better understand what your user are doing in the VR app. It's like a Google Analytics but for VR.
